# Capital-Offense
U.S. State Capitals and State Nicknames Testing / Quiz Game that records the user's name, total testing time , and final score which is written to a data file in the program's document directory. The same file is read to check if the user has ever tested at any point in the past. If any testing history for the user *is* found, the record(s) are used in comparison of the student's performance and progress analysis, if *any* / applicable.


### Purpose & Intent - Details
_______________________________
My knowledge of Python and the skillset I possess doesn't quite constitute defining a purpose for this small, simple application - honestly, this was more a learning experience project... a kind of personal goal to complete as an exercise. Being self-taught, the teacher kind of sucks and is only able to dedicate spare time towards advancing and progressing in the Python programming language. With this in mind, please realize and understand while the application functions as it should, my Python capabilities are, at best, barely intermediate *if that*; hence any issues with bugs, runtime exceptions, or overall coding structure will reflect said level of expertise.

With no initial purpose, intent, or real reason to define either until now, a split second of consideration makes it so obvious that I feel it should be silently understood without explaining, honestly. The only purpose or "real-life" application of the Capital Offense program is of an educational nature, however, the particular material for which this program focuses its testing is *__not__* a mandatory part of the system-wide curriculum or even considered high in priority, important, or necessary at all in some state/county schools.

Nevertheless, such a small and simple application is equally as simplistically small in terms of it's scope of *"real world"* implementations - **EDUCATION!!** That's it. So ultimately, whether schools consider U.S. Capital cities pertinent or not, perhaps each student should be given the option to decide themselves. Potentially, any students that *choose* to learn can utilize the Capital Offense program as a helpful resource and testing tool.
